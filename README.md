## Installation | Ionic

### Description
Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command-line utility. The Ionic CLI is the preferred method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way. It is also the main tool through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Ionic Appflow.

## Project Setup

### Description
We will create and setup an ionic project with named 'Ionic-Angular-Project-Setup', assuming that you have installed ionic cli and node.js.

| No. | Steps |
|---- | ---------
|1 | Using System/VS Code/Any Editor's terminal, Navigate into the folder where you want to create your new project folder for ionic project once you navigate it. |
|2 | In Terminal, execute the below command. |
|3 | **`ionic start`** |  
|4 | This basically generates you a project.Now, it will ask you a couple of questions like what should be the name of that project and I'll name it 'Ionic-Angular-Project-Setup' but you can of course choose any name you want. |
|5 | Project name: **`Ionic-Angular-Project-Setup`** |
|6 | Next you can choose from a couple of templates. Now the list here could change over time. You essentially have the choice between a blank template which is totally empty project with just a starting page, the side menu template where you have a side menu you can slide in from the left and a tabs menu where you have some taps at the bottom. |
|7 | Starter template: **`blank`** |
|8 | This will generate a new project with blank template and install all the dependencies like angular and ionic.
